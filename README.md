## Tech Stack
We built our model using Pytorch and the `sklearn` library. The frontend was developed using Next.js.

## How to Run
First, navigate to the `ml-service` directory and follow the instructions there to set up a virtual environment, install the required dependencies, and run the service. (Note: these instructions were written for UNIX-based machines, but the scripts required to run the backend will work on any operating system). 

Then, navigate to the `web-client` directory and follow the instructions there to install dependencies and run the frontend.
