This is an [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) project functioning as the backend server.

## Getting Started

First, navigate to the correct folder and install any dependencies:

```bash
cd server
npm i
```

To run the server for development (what y'all are most likely here for), run the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```
This enables hot reload (the server will restart and auto-update whenever you save any changes).

To run the server for deployment, run the following commands:

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```
